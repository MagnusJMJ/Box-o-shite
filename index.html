    <h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>How we came up with our idea</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Our game concept was spawned and decided on in the initial phase of idea generation, through a predominantly free and unstructured discussion in the group that lasted for approximately four hours.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">We did consider employing techniques from our Design Processes course last year (Inspiration card workshops in particular were considered), but never got around to it. We opted for a loose approach simply because it was the path of least resistance, which in retrospect, had both benefits and drawbacks. One of the benefits was, that we could segue smoothly from the abstract to the concrete, which let us probe ideas and discuss them in very specific terms before deciding to discard or further cultivate them. The biggest drawback by far, was the lack of documentation - crucial ideas were noted, either on the bulletin board or the whiteboard, but many nuances and smaller points were lost. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The idea was based upon and inspired by:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Our research about mimicry, and how we could make a player feel emotions by making them act certain ways.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Our research about player NPC interactions, and the interplay between player and crowd.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The game, mr. president, where the player is constantly trying to avoid assassination attempts.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Challenges and how we handled them</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400">The gamejam was off to a slightly tedious start. We went a lot back and forth with our idea. The main goal of our idea was to test if we could make players emotionally invested if they got points for acting in a certain way. It was really hard finding a way to do this while still maintaining a simple and interesting gameplay. Delays in the schedule and drawn out pre-jam talks contributed to a low-velocity environment, and the task of refining our domain (expressing emotions in VR) into a concrete idea or concept was daunting at first. In spite of this, the initial phase of idea generation went very well - fluent discussion quickened the pace of the jam, but most importantly; externalization of ideas and arguments gave us a foundation to work on.</span>

Using unreal, it was quite tough - considering the limited timeframe - to make multiple audience members that had separate pictures, this was later solved by making each audience member completely separate objects that had the exact same code, but simply a different texture attached to them. Having different excitement levels for the audience and applying them to all 6 which required a global variable. This excitement level would determine how fast the audience bounced up and down, and if they would cheer or boo the player.  Connecting this global variable to the audience members took quite some time. We also struggled with having the player enter first person virtual reality in our environment upon starting the finished compiled program.

<span style="font-weight: 400">One of our main struggles was making this idea fun or interesting, while still being able to force a player to say preprogrammed words with set emotions. The lack of player freedom was something that might detract more from the immersion than our face tracking and VR technology would add. We decided to throw in the added challenge of random assassination attempts to the player while the speech was being held. In this way we could give the players some freedom to counter the assassinations, while still having them read from the teleprompter in a certain way. Another challenge we faced was adding the text to the teleprompter in the showcase video. We solved this by just adding the text to the bottom of the screen instead of having it appear ingame.</span>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>The key decisions</strong></h2>
Visual and interface-related questions were easy to solve by doing quick mock-ups on the whiteboard.

<p style="text-align: center"><b><i>Whiteboard during the specification period of the game mechanics and design process</i></b></p>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">For example, the design of the hypothetical user interface began with a sketch on the whiteboard, which was occasionally tweaked (overhauled, even) as the jam progressed. Strategic questions, like what software to use for the prototype, were not necessarily well-reflected, but still resolved fairly quickly due to half the group’s experience with the Unreal game engine. When disagreements arose on key questions, the group attempted to dissect each option and measure each point of view against each other, while their respective proponents (ideally) tried to argue academically for them. Disagreements were solved by a democratic vote after a discussion. We also put up a google doc for noting pros and cons for our different ideas, and reviewing them side by side.</span>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Materials and how we used them</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Especially the whiteboard and bulletin board in our room were helpful in keeping track of progress, noting key concepts, and creating quick illustrations.</span>

<p style="text-align: center"><b><i>Post-it notes of different game concepts from the early idea-phase</i></b></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400">In an otherwise very “laissez faire” process, writing and drawing were ways to ‘save’ key points for later, so we didn’t have to keep everything in our head. Likewise, recorded sessions where we discussed a particular subject (or just made a status update on our progress) were also part of the externalization of knowledge. Curiously, the fact that it was recorded seemed to change the way we discussed, but the recordings went largely untouched for the remainder of the jam. Nevertheless, the ability to revisit an oral discussion was a valuable option, and one could just as easily have imagined a scenario where it could have been crucial. The mock-up video was made by editing footage from casper playing the game together with footage of him holding the actual speech. The assassination attempts, public opinion meter and text was added in post. The video editing software used was Adobe After effects and premiere pro.</span>
